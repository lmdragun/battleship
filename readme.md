<h2>Setup</h2>
CreateBattleShip.new in pry. Then run the game outside of pry.

<h2>Background</h2>

This is the first Project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive, fifth class. It was assigned and coded during our third week of class. There were the projects possible,  a personal finance app, a flash cards app, and this battleship app.

<h2>Development</h2>

I began working through possible rspec tests and pseudo-code, then started writing the Ruby code based on using ActiveRecord classes. I created a one-dimensional array for the grid, that would populate each time the game started and appear on screen broken into a neat board for players. I then created arrays for the ships and began to implement the game process.

<h2>Issues</h2>

The original question of how to configure and populate the grid was the major issue, as there are various ways to go about doing it. Two dimensional arrays and an array of hashes were also options. Working with ActiveRecord in Ruby, and not Rails, was also an interesting experience.

<h2>Icebox</h2>

Loading old games, multi-player functionality, and more randomized ships would be added with more time.
